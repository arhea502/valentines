        Okay this is just me yapping. You're free to scroll down and go to the next page. I don't blame you <br><br>
        
        Uhh yea just wanted to text now that I've got the chance to. Uh I've been good? like I'm okay. not too bad atleast. It's odd icl. I've been way too confused about things. <br><br>

        But yeah, back to talking... I always thought that there’s something so special about the connection between us. Even when you blocked me and all, the feeling that you'd be back?? made me feel not so alone and it was something that made a huge difference. Maybe it’s the little things that count the most, like sharing a moment of peace or helping each other out when life gets tough because that's kinda what we always did after long periods of no contact.. I don’t know… It’s hard to put into words what I mean exactly, but I hope you get the point. <br><br>

        It's not always about big gestures or grand displays of affection. It’s about the quiet moments, the little smiles, the gestures that speak louder than words. Sometimes just being there, existing in each other's world, is enough.. I used to sometimes feel like I needed some big event or some major thing in order to be good enough for you. So I'd feel really insecure when there was nothing I could do, but I don't regret anything. It was sweet and fun. I got to fall for you everytime you came back after long periods of no contact. So yeah, thank you for being there. Thank you for everything, even when words fail to fully express it, I did truly value it all. <br><br>
        
        And I know that we're both just trying our best, navigating through life, learning to love, and it’s okay to feel lost at times, or unsure of things. We don’t have to have all the answers. We just have to keep going, knowing we’re not alone. I don't exactly blame you or me. I just feel upset because obiously I was upset, but guilty about it because we both got hurt, but that's how we are. <span>No, this isnt some confession weirdo. All I'm saying is. I apreciate you.</span> <br><br>

        Okay, that’s enough talking for now. I’ll stop before I say too much, haha. Thanks for listening, or reading... You know what I mean. <br><br>
        
        I do truly love you man. and I dont mean the sex kiss marry each other type (ofc I do, but you're worth more than that). I mean the friendly lets just be okay because I like you and you're pretty cool.  no no no I'll respect your decisions dw. this is just me being emotional and stupid.
